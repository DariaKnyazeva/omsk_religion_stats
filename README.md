Jupyter notebook for Omsk, Russia Religion statistics

# Omsk, Omsk Oblast, Russia and its religion.

The data is downloaded from http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOs.aspx 

Minjust is the Ministry of Justice of Russian Federation, these particular reports are free to download. 

The questions I answer here:

* What is the religion distribution based on the registered religious organisations?
* What is the activity of the registered religious organisations (ceremonies, religious education, charity)?
* What are the yearly expenditures of the religious organisations on their needs?

The picture is not full as not all religions are registered as organisations. For example, pagans, atheists, satanists etc. are left out. Also, very few organisations provided activity reports.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to answer the question about the religion demographic data, as it is forbidden by law to publish suh information.
